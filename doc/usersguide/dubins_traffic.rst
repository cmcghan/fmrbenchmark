Problem domain: Traffic network of Dubins cars
==============================================

Often referred to as "the second domain," the basic setting is navigation in a
small network of roads with vehicles that follow unicycle-like dynamics.

Many components of this problem domain are not ready for users. To begin
exploring the currently available pieces, a good place to begin is the file
``README`` in the directory ``domains/dubins_traffic/`` in the
`fmrbenchmark repository <https://github.com/fmrchallenge/fmrbenchmark>`_.
