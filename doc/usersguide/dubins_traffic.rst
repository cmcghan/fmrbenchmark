Problem domain: Traffic network of Dubins cars
==============================================

Often referred to as "the second domain," the basic setting is navigation in a
small network of roads with vehicles that follow unicycle-like dynamics.


Preparations

While below we include pointers to the main websites for dependencies, many are
available via packages for your OS and may already be installed, especially if
you have ROS on Ubuntu 14.04. Supported platforms are described in the :doc:`intro`.
