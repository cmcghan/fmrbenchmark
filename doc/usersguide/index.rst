User's Guide
============

This is the User's Guide to the fmrbenchmark repository. The two other major
forms of documentation are the API manual and the benchmark specifications.
Among the latter documents are competition rules. Besides these sources of
documentation, there are comments in the code as well as README and similar
files throughout the repository.

For newcomers, a good place to begin is the :doc:`intro`.
