This is the API manual for the <a href="https://github.com/fmrchallenge/fmrbenchmark">fmrbenchmark repository</a>,
 which is part of a <a href="http://fmrchallenge.org">project</a> to develop benchmark problems for research in
so-called "formal methods for robotics." This API manual is of interest if you
will extend, modify, or in general, work directly with the source code of the
various benchmarks and supporting infrastructure. For installation instructions,
introductions about usage, and examples, consult the <a href="http://docs.fmrchallenge.org">User's Guide</a>.
