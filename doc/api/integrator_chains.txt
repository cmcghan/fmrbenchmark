/** \defgroup integrator_chains Problem domain: Scaling chains of integrators

Problems in this domain require construction of a controller---if one
exists---for a chain of integrators so that resulting trajectories satisfy a
reach-and-avoid specification.

The notation and relevant theory is developed elsewhere. Our treatment here
focuses on the programming interface.
