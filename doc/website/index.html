<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We present the first challenge on formal methods for robotics.  Formal
methods refers broadly to techniques for the verification and automatic
synthesis of transition systems that satisfy desirable properties exactly or
within some statistical tolerance.  Though historically developed for concurrent
software, recent work has brought these methods to bear on motion planning in
robotics.  Challenges specific to robotics, such as uncertainty and real-time
constraints, have motivated extensions to existing methods and entirely novel
treatments.  However, compared to other areas within robotics research,
demonstrations of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale.  The
proposed robotics challenge seeks to motivate advancement of the state of the
art toward practical realization.  The challenge is organized into three problem
domains: arbitrary dimensional double integrators, roads with Dubins cars, and
manipulation tasks on the assembly line.</p>

<p>

The <em>scaling double integrators</em> domain is the simplest in terms of
dynamics, yet unlike the other domains, the system to be controlled can be
scaled easily to arbitrarily many dimensions.  While this problem is abstract in
the sense that it is not modeling a specific physical system, it is
well-motivated because the double-integrator is just the basic force equation
(F=ma) of Newtonian mechanics, up to a scaling factor.  In other words, this
problem domain concerns acceleration of a point-mass in high-dimensional spaces
so as to visit goal regions and avoid obstacles.

<h3 id="dubinstraffic">Dubins traffic</h3>
<p>

The <em>Dubins traffic</em> domain involves navigation in a small network of
two-lane roads with vehicles that have Dubins car dynamics.  There is an
adversary that selects the motion of other cars.  The adversary is subject to
assumptions such as obeying traffic rules and not parking unfairly at locations
that must be eventually reached by the controller.

<h3 id="#pickandplace">pick-and-place</h3>
<p>

The <em>pick-and-place</em> domain concerns dexterous manipulation tasks based
on assembly line concerns.  pick and place tasks, expressed using LTL contracts,
as described below. The key challenges explored in this problem domain will
include uncertainty in the shape and dynamics of the end-effector, as well as
objects that are being grasped, and collision-avoidance with moving obstacles
that come into the workspace.  </p> </div>
