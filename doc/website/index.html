<h1>The First Challenge on Formal Methods for Robotics</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We present the first challenge on formal methods for robotics.  Formal
methods refers broadly to techniques for the verification and automatic
synthesis of transition systems that satisfy desirable properties exactly or
within some statistical tolerance.  Though historically developed for concurrent
software, recent work has brought these methods to bear on motion planning in
robotics.  Challenges specific to robotics, such as uncertainty and real-time
constraints, have motivated extensions to existing methods and entirely novel
treatments.  However, compared to other areas within robotics research,
demonstrations of formal methods have been surprisingly small-scale.  The
proposed robotics challenge seeks to motivate advancement of the state of the
art toward practical realization.  The challenge is organized into three problem
domains: arbitrary dimensional double integrators, roads with Dubins cars, and
manipulation tasks on the assembly line.</p>
