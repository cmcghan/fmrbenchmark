There are many ways to contribute. This file provides a summary. There is also a
more [detailed page](http://docs.fmrchallenge.org/en/latest/contributing.html)
in [the User's Guide](http://docs.fmrchallenge.org).

* Join our mailing list, [fmrbenchmark-users@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fmrbenchmark-users)

* Find unassigned tasks or recommend solution methods in the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/fmrchallenge/fmrbenchmark/issues).

Outside contributions should be submitted according to the fork-and-pull-request
workflow to facilitate a public record of review and discussion.  When doing so
is not appropriate or not easily possible, other media are welcome, e.g.,
sending patches via email.

All contributions must be under the standard "BSD 3-clause license" or a
comparable open-source license.
