transform: 0 0 0  # x y theta, as a point in SE(2); rotation is in radians.
# Unlike segment coordinates, the transform is not scaled by length.

# Segment coordinates as used in the "segments" field are scaled by
# the length value and then transformed.
segments:
0 0 0 1  # A segment of road from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1)
0 1 1 1
