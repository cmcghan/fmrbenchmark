Problem domain: Dexterous manipulation on the assembly line
===========================================================

Summary
-------

This domain concerns dexterous manipulation tasks motivated by assembly line
activities.


Installation
------------

A good start is the "desktop-full" configuration of ROS Indigo.  Additional
dependencies:
* [baxter_description](http://wiki.ros.org/baxter_description), the repository
  for which is at <https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_common>, which must
  be obtained manually, i.e., I (Scott) am not aware of official availability as
  part of ROS Indigo.

For the simulation variant, also consult `pandp_sim/extern/README.md` about
obtaining some of the models.
